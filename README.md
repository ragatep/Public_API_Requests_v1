Teamtreehouse - Project 5<br />
Public API Requests

Hello Internet.

I built this [web app](https://ragatep.github.io/Public_API_Requests_v1/)  to demonstrate my skills, including working with public APIs and making API requests and asynchronously handling the data.
This app uses the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees" and use that data to build an employee directory web app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup. This build is for a project from Teamtreehouse's Techdegree Full Stack Javascript Unit 5.

More about this web app:

 - This web app unfortanately doesnâ€™t work using Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 but works on most modern browsers.
 - I attempted to build and add a search function that could be used to filter the list by name.
